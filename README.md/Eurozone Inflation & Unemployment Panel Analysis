# Eurozone Inflation & Unemployment Panel Analysis

This project investigates whether the Phillips Curve relationship still holds in modern European economies.

The analysis uses multi-country panel data and econometric modeling to evaluate how unemployment affects inflation across the Eurozone and how this relationship changes after controlling for common macroeconomic shocks.

## Research Question

Does unemployment negatively affect inflation in the Eurozone, or has the relationship weakened in recent decades?

---

## Data Sources

- Eurostat – Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)
- Eurostat – Monthly unemployment rate

All data is automatically collected via API and fully reproducible using the provided scripts.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Pipeline
- Automated data download using Eurostat API
- Cleaning and restructuring into panel format (country–time)
- Handling missing values and aligning frequencies

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Year-over-year inflation calculation
- 12-month smoothed inflation
- Lagged unemployment (6 months)

### 3. Econometric Modeling
Panel Fixed Effects Regression:

- Country fixed effects
- Country + Time fixed effects
- Statistical significance testing

## Key Findings

1. When only country differences are considered, unemployment negatively predicts inflation (classic Phillips Curve).

2. After controlling for time shocks (pandemic, energy crisis, supply disruptions), the relationship weakens and reverses.

**Interpretation:**  
Modern Eurozone inflation is driven more by macroeconomic supply shocks than labor market tightness.
