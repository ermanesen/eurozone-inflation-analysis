# Eurozone Inflation & Unemployment Panel Analysis

This project investigates whether the Phillips Curve relationship holds in modern European economies.

Specifically, it analyzes the relationship between unemployment and inflation across selected Eurozone countries using panel data econometrics.

---

## Research Question
Does unemployment negatively affect inflation in the Eurozone, or has the relationship weakened due to macroeconomic shocks?

---

## Data Sources
- Eurostat: Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)
- Eurostat: Monthly unemployment rate
- Monthly observations across multiple Eurozone countries

The dataset is fully reproducible using the provided scripts.

## Methodology

1. Automated data collection via API
2. Panel dataset construction (country–time structure)
3. Feature engineering
   - Year-over-year inflation
   - 12-month smoothed inflation
   - Lagged unemployment (6 months)
4. Econometric modeling
   - Fixed Effects (country)
   - Fixed Effects (country + time)
5. Statistical inference

## Key Findings

- A negative unemployment–inflation relationship appears when only country differences are considered.
- After controlling for time shocks (energy crisis, pandemic, supply disruptions), the relationship weakens and reverses.
- This suggests inflation in recent years is driven more by common macroeconomic shocks than labor market tightness.

In other words: modern Eurozone inflation behaves more like cost-push inflation than demand-pull inflation.
